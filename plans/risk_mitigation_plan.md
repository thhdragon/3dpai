## Onboarding & How to Use
**Who should use this?** Anyone responsible for safety, reliability, or compliance in the 3dpai project.

**How to use:**
- Review the actionable checklist and phased workflow below.
- Reference the rationale for risk methodology and sample FMEA table for implementation guidance.
- For technical and data dependencies, see the Data Engineering & Evaluation plans.

---

## Rationale for Risk Methodology
- **FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis):** Systematic approach to identifying, prioritizing, and mitigating risks. Chosen for its industry adoption and structured scoring.
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** Proactive detection of anomalies and failures to minimize impact and ensure safety.
- **Emergency Stop & Fallback:** Ensures safe system behavior in the event of critical failures or unexpected conditions.

## Sample FMEA Table
| Component | Failure Mode | Effect | Severity (1-10) | Likelihood (1-10) | Detection (1-10) | Risk Priority Number (RPN) | Mitigation |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| Heater | Thermal runaway | Fire hazard | 10 | 2 | 3 | 60 | Add thermal cutoff, monitor temp |
| Stepper driver | Missed steps | Print failure | 6 | 5 | 4 | 120 | Add encoder feedback, alert user |
| Network | Outage | Loss of remote control | 4 | 6 | 5 | 120 | Local fallback, retry logic |

## 1. Risk Categories & Identification
- **Technical Risks:** Model hallucination, sim-to-real transfer gap, data pipeline failures, integration bugs
- **Operational Risks:** Hardware malfunctions, network outages, resource exhaustion
- **Safety Risks:** Unintended printer motion, thermal runaway, failure to detect hazards
- **Data & Privacy Risks:** Data leaks, unauthorized access, non-compliance with regulations
- **User Experience Risks:** Poor troubleshooting, excessive intervention, confusing feedback

---

## 2. Failure Mode Analysis
- Systematic review of potential failure points in simulation, adaptation, and real-world phases
- Use of FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) tables for critical components
- Prioritization by likelihood and impact

---

## 3. Mitigation Strategies
- **Technical:**
    - Redundant validation (unit/integration tests, A/B testing)
    - Conservative fallback policies (manual override, safe defaults)
    - Continuous monitoring and automated rollback
- **Operational:**
    - Hardware watchdogs, redundant power and network
    - Resource monitoring and auto-scaling
- **Safety:**
    - Hardware interlocks, strict thermal/motion limits
    - Human-in-the-loop for critical actions
    - Emergency stop and alerting systems
- **Data & Privacy:**
    - Encryption, access controls, anonymization
    - Regular audits and compliance checks
- **User Experience:**
    - Clear feedback, guided troubleshooting, user education
    - Feedback loop for continuous improvement

---

## 4. Monitoring & Response Protocols
- Real-time alerting for anomalies and safety violations
- Automated incident logging and escalation
- Regular review of risk metrics and incident reports
- Playbooks for rapid response and recovery

---

## 5. Documentation & Reporting
- Maintain risk register and FMEA tables
- Document all incidents, mitigations, and lessons learned
- Share regular risk assessment updates with stakeholders

---

## 6. Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Baseline Risk Assessment
- Identify and document initial risks for simulation and pipeline phases
- Implement basic monitoring and fallback mechanisms

### Phase 2: Safety & Compliance Integration
- Add hardware/software safety interlocks and compliance checks

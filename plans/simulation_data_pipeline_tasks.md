## Onboarding & How to Use
**Who should use this?** Anyone implementing, maintaining, or extending the simulation data pipeline for the 3dpai project.

**How to use:**
- Review the task breakdown and rationale below to understand the pipeline structure.
- Use the dependencies table to plan implementation order and identify blockers.
- For technical details and data formats, see the Data Engineering & Ingestion Design docs.

---

## Rationale for Task Breakdown
- **Modularity:** Each task is a self-contained module, enabling parallel development and easier debugging.
- **Automation:** Automated ingestion, validation, and feature extraction are critical for scaling data generation and ensuring consistency.
- **Traceability:** Organized, versioned datasets and metadata support reproducibility and auditability.

## Task Dependencies & Suggested Order
| Task | Depends On |
|------|------------|
| Ingestion & Validation | - |
| Parsing & Preprocessing | Ingestion & Validation |
| Feature Engineering | Parsing & Preprocessing |
| Multi-Modal Alignment | Feature Engineering |
| Dataset Organization & Versioning | Multi-Modal Alignment |
| Automation & Testing | All above |

## 1. Inputs
- Prunt3D simulation outputs (G-code, sensor logs, images, audio)
- Sliced G-code in verbose mode (with comments and metadata)

---

## 2. Core Tasks

### 2.1 Ingestion & Validation
- [ ] Script to ingest Prunt3D simulation outputs (all supported formats)
- [ ] Script to ingest verbose G-code files
- [ ] Data validation: check completeness, file integrity, and schema compliance

### 2.2 Parsing & Preprocessing
- [ ] Parser for verbose G-code (extract comments, metadata, layer info, print settings)
- [ ] Normalization of units, timestamps, and formats
- [ ] Cleaning: remove corrupt/incomplete records

### 2.3 Feature Engineering
- [ ] Extract features from sensor logs (temperature, vibration, etc.)
- [ ] Identify and label print events (layer changes, failures, recoveries)
- [ ] Generate print quality and performance metrics

### 2.4 Multi-Modal Alignment
- [ ] Synchronize time series data (sensor, G-code, images, audio)
- [ ] Align all modalities to a common timeline for each print session

### 2.5 Dataset Organization & Versioning
- [ ] Organize processed data by phase, modality, and scenario type
- [ ] Generate metadata files for provenance and traceability
- [ ] Integrate with DVC or similar for dataset versioning

### 2.6 Automation & Testing
- [ ] Develop ETL pipeline scripts/workflows
- [ ] Automated test suite for pipeline validation (unit and integration tests)
- [ ] Logging and error reporting for pipeline runs

---

## 3. Outputs
- Structured, versioned datasets ready for LLM training, benchmarking, and downstream tasks

---

## 4. Milestones
- [ ] Prototype ingestion and parsing scripts
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline for a single print session
- [ ] Automated tests passing on sample data
- [ ] Scalable pipeline for batch processing
- [ ] Integration with LLM training and evaluation workflows

---

## 5. Open Questions
- What are the most common failure points in Prunt3D and slicer outputs?
- How to best represent multi-modal alignment for downstream models?
- What metadata is essential for reproducibility and traceability?

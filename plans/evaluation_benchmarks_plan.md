## Onboarding & How to Use
**Who should use this?** Anyone working on model evaluation, benchmarking, or monitoring for the 3dpai project.

**How to use:**
- Review the actionable checklist and phased workflow below.
- Reference the rationale for metric selection and example outputs for implementation guidance.
- For data and model requirements, see the Data Engineering & LLM Training plans.

---

## Rationale for Metrics & Evaluation Approach
- **Accuracy & Recovery Rate:** Core indicators of model performance in predicting print success and handling failures.
- **Print Quality Metrics:** Quantitative and qualitative measures (e.g., surface finish, dimensional accuracy) to assess real-world impact.
- **A/B Testing & Regression:** Ensures new models outperform or match previous baselines and do not introduce regressions.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Review:** Captures nuanced feedback and edge cases not covered by automated metrics.

## Example Output Formats
**Evaluation Results (CSV):**
```csv
run_id,metric,score
run_00001,accuracy,0.98
run_00001,recovery_rate,0.95
run_00001,print_quality,4.5
...existing data...
```

**Dashboard Snapshot (JSON):**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-24T12:00:00Z",
  "model_version": "phase1_qwen_finetuned",
  "metrics": {
    "accuracy": 0.98,
    "recovery_rate": 0.95,
    "print_quality": 4.5
  }
}
```

## 1. Technical Metrics
- **Print Success Rate:** % of prints completed without critical errors
- **Failure Detection Accuracy:** Precision/recall for identifying failure modes
- **G-code Generation Quality:** Syntax correctness, printability, efficiency
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer Gap:** Performance delta between simulation and real-world
- **Recovery Rate:** % of failures autonomously recovered
- **Resource Utilization:** Compute, memory, and time per print

---

## 2. User Experience Metrics
- **Setup Time:** Time to first successful print
- **User Intervention Rate:** Number of manual adjustments per print
- **Troubleshooting Time:** Time to resolve issues
- **Print Quality Consistency:** Variance in surface finish, dimensional accuracy
- **User Satisfaction:** Survey or rating-based feedback

---

## 3. Benchmark Datasets
- **Simulation Benchmarks:** Prunt3D-generated scenarios (standard, edge cases, failures)
- **Sliced G-code Benchmarks:** Realistic prints with verbose metadata
- **Real-World Benchmarks:** Controlled print sessions, user-submitted logs
- **Multi-Modal Benchmarks:** Sensor, image, and audio data for holistic evaluation

---

## 4. Validation Protocols
- **Unit Testing:** Isolated evaluation of LLM outputs (G-code, explanations)
- **Integration Testing:** End-to-end print simulations and real hardware runs
- **A/B Testing:** Compare new models against baseline in production
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Automated checks for drift, degradation, and anomalies
- **Human-in-the-Loop Review:** Expert validation of critical outputs

---

## 5. Continuous Evaluation & Monitoring
- Automated metric dashboards
- Alerting for performance drops or safety issues
- Scheduled re-benchmarking after major updates
- Feedback loop from user reports and print outcomes

---

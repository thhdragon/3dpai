# Data Engineering & Management Plan

## Purpose
Comprehensive plan for data collection, storage, preprocessing, augmentation, and privacy for the LLM-controlled 3D printer OS. This document is intended for data engineers, ML researchers, and contributors working on the data pipeline. It provides rationale for technology choices, onboarding guidance, and practical examples.

## Rationale for Key Technology Choices
- **DVC (Data Version Control):** Enables reproducible, versioned datasets and seamless collaboration across local/cloud storage. Chosen for its integration with Git and support for large files.
- **Hierarchical Directory Structure:** Organizes data by phase, modality, and scenario, making it easy to locate, audit, and extend datasets.
- **JSON/CSV Formats:** Widely supported, human-readable, and easy to parse for both structured and semi-structured data.
- **Automated ETL Scripts:** Ensures consistency, reduces manual errors, and supports scaling as data volume grows.

---

## 1. Data Sources & Ingestion
- **Simulation Data:** Prunt3D outputs (G-code, sensor logs, images, audio)
- **Sliced G-code (Verbose Mode):** G-code files generated with verbose comments and metadata from slicers (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer)
- **Real-World Data:** Printer logs, sensor streams, user feedback, maintenance records
- **Multi-Modal Data:** Text, images, audio, time-series sensor data

---

## 2. Data Storage & Organization
- Hierarchical directory structure by phase, modality, and scenario type
- Use of metadata files for provenance and traceability
- Scalable storage solutions (local, cloud, hybrid)
- Data versioning with DVC or similar tools

---

## 3. Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Cleaning: remove corrupt/incomplete records, normalize formats
- Tokenization: G-code (including verbose comments/metadata), configuration files, logs
- Parsing and extracting structured information from verbose G-code (layer changes, print settings, slicer metadata)
- Feature extraction: sensor trends, error patterns, print quality metrics
- Multi-modal alignment: synchronize data streams to common timeline

---

## 4. Data Augmentation & Synthesis
- Parameter sweeps and scenario generation in simulation
- Noise injection and domain randomization
- Synthetic failure mode creation
- Multi-material and complex geometry scenarios

---

## 5. Privacy, Compliance & Security
- Anonymization of user and printer identifiers
- Local processing for sensitive data
- Consent management and audit trails
- Compliance with relevant data protection standards (GDPR, etc.)

---

## 6. Pipeline Automation & Monitoring
- Automated ETL scripts for ingestion, cleaning, and transformation
- Continuous integration with simulation and real-world data sources
- Monitoring for data drift, quality, and pipeline failures
- Alerting and logging for anomalies

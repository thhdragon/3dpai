## Purpose & How to Use
This living document is for capturing open questions, speculative ideas, research leads, and ongoing team ideation for the LLM-controlled 3D printer OS project. Use it to:
- Log new research questions and technical challenges as they arise
- Assign owners and track status of each question
- Summarize findings and decisions as research progresses
- Coordinate brainstorming and research efforts across the team

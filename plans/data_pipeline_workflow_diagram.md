# Data Pipeline Workflow Diagram (Textual Draft)

## Overview
A high-level workflow for the simulation and real-world data pipeline, from raw data ingestion to LLM-ready datasets.

---

1. **Data Ingestion**
    - Prunt3D simulation outputs (G-code, sensor logs, images, audio)
    - Sliced G-code (verbose mode)
    - Real-world printer logs and sensor data

2. **Validation & Cleaning**
    - Check file presence and integrity
    - Remove corrupt/incomplete records
    - Normalize formats and units

3. **Parsing & Feature Engineering**
    - Parse G-code and extract metadata
    - Extract features from sensor logs
    - Label print events and failures

4. **Multi-Modal Alignment**
    - Synchronize time series, images, audio
    - Align all data to a common timeline

5. **Dataset Organization & Versioning**
    - Organize by phase, modality, scenario
    - Add metadata and provenance
    - Version with DVC or similar

6. **Output**
    - Structured, validated, and versioned datasets for LLM training and benchmarking
